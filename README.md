# Image tampering detection using deep learning | SELF PROJECT

* Developed CNN-based image tampering detection using CASIA v2.0 dataset and Error Level Analysis (ELA).
* Built end-to-end TensorFlow/Keras pipeline for image pre-processing, training, and inference.
* Achieved 0.89 test accuracy, effectively detecting and classifying authentic versus tampered images..
